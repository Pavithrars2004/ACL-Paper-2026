More formally, it is the unique value that the output of a function (or the terms of a sequence) gets arbitrarily close to as the input (or index) gets arbitrarily close to a specified point (or tends toward infinity).

Crucially, the function or sequence does not necessarily have to actually *reach* this value, nor does it even have to be defined at the point being approached for the limit to exist.

**Example (for a function):** If $\lim_{x \to c} f(x) = L$, it means that as $x$ gets closer and closer to $c$ (from either side), the value of $f(x)$ gets closer and closer to $L$.",no,no,no,True
445,Mathematics & Logic,Integral,"An **integral** is a fundamental concept in calculus that generalizes the idea of summing infinitesimally small quantities. It has two primary forms:

*   **Definite Integral:** Represents the total accumulation of a quantity, most commonly visualized as the signed area between the graph of a function and the x-axis over a specified interval.
*   **Indefinite Integral (or Antiderivative):** Represents the inverse operation of differentiation, yielding a family of functions whose derivative is the original function (often denoted with a `+ C`).",yes,yes,yes,True
446,Mathematics & Logic,Integral,"**Integral**

In mathematics, specifically calculus, an **integral** is an operation that quantifies the total accumulation of a quantity. It primarily has two interpretations:

1.  **Accumulation/Area:** It is used to sum an infinite number of infinitesimal parts to find a total, such as the area under a curve, volume, or the total change of a quantity over an interval.
2.  **Antidifferentiation:** It is the inverse operation to differentiation, finding a function (called an antiderivative) whose derivative is the original function.

There are two main types:
*   **Definite Integral:** Calculates the net accumulation over a specific interval, resulting in a numerical value.
*   **Indefinite Integral (or Antiderivative):** Represents the family of all functions whose derivative is a given function, including an arbitrary constant.",no,no,no,True
